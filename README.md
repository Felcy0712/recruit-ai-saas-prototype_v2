## Overview

Recruit-AI is an agentic AI-powered recruiting tool designed to address inefficiencies in the hiring market for small to mid-sized companies. These organizations often receive hundreds of resumes for open roles but lack dedicated HR staff to screen them effectively, leading to decision fatigue, slow time-to-hire, and poor candidate experiences.

### Target User
"Sarah," a Talent Acquisition Manager or Founder at a 50-person tech company. She is overwhelmed by administrative tasks and fears missing out on great talent due to being buried in PDFs.

### The Problem
High-volume screening results in decision fatigue, prolonged hiring timelines, and suboptimal candidate experiences.

### The Solution
An agentic AI solution that automates the "Screening & Scheduling" phase of recruitment.

### 💥 Why Agentic AI?

Hiring today is still stuck in the past:

✖️ Endless resume screening
✖️ Back-and-forth scheduling
✖️ Candidate disengagement

So reimagined the process – with AI at its core.
And the results? Game-changing.

🎯 Key Features
- **Automated Resume Screening**: AI parses and analyzes resumes against job descriptions.
- **Candidate Ranking and Shortlisting**: Intelligent scoring and prioritization of candidates.
- **Interview Scheduling**: Automated scheduling and email invites for shortlisted candidates.
- **Dashboard Management**: User-friendly interface for managing candidates, roles, scheduling, and analytics.
- **Integration with n8n**: Leverages n8n for AI processing workflows.
